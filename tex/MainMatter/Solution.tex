\par In this chapter the development of the solution will be reported step by step, with a full use case. The chapter starts with a list of similar solutions already developed, highlighting the differences between them and my thesis work. The remaining part is composed of tree mains sections: the first explains the choice of the network, the architecture, the naming service, etc. It lays the foundations for the second part: the definition of the Liquid Android middleware, or better the structure of what will do the magic: intercept, encapsulate, spread, and generate distributed intents in the network so made. The two parts are closely related, therefore their relation was taken into account when I made my choice.\\
The real implementation of the valid solution is left for the next chapter.
